# SAR Ship Detection Project

## Overview

The SAR Ship Detection Project is an end-to-end system designed for the automated detection and tracking of maritime vessels using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. This project leverages advanced deep learning models to process SAR data, primarily from Sentinel-1 satellites, providing crucial insights for maritime domain awareness, safety, and security. A key focus of this project is the detection of **"dark vessels," by integrating AIS (Automatic Identification System) data with SAR observations to identify vessels that are not broadcasting their location.** Optimized for efficient inference on edge devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, this solution aims to bridge the gap between powerful machine learning and deployable satellite-based applications.

This project is still a Work In Progress, so you may see a few placeholders.

## üì¶ Application

### Overview

The `FullApp` directory encapsulates a comprehensive Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection application, integrating all functionalities developed throughout this project. This application provides an end-to-end pipeline for processing, tracking, and analyzing ships using radar imagery. It enables users to upload raw SAR data, explore Google Earth Engine SAR collections, and leverage cloud-based AI for robust inference. The system features an intuitive web-based dashboard for visualizing detailed reports, including global annotated images, sub-images of detected ships, and ship metadata (e.g., pixel area and surface area in square meters). Additionally, it supports export of results and is optimized for edge deployment on platforms like NVIDIA Jetson Nano, facilitating real-time inference without requiring prior land-ocean segmentation. This dual-targeted architecture ensures both operational efficiency in edge environments and user-friendly interaction for maritime surveillance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

Choose your preferred setup method:

#### Docker Setup (Recommended)

docker-compose up -d --build

# Application available at http://localhost:8501
# No additional environment configuration needed
```

#### Local Environment Setup
To ensure a clean, reproducible, and isolated environment for running the application locally:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   Create a Python virtual environment (e.g., named `.venv`) to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   Activate the virtual environment to use its isolated Python interpreter and packages:  
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` to ensure compatibility and reproducibility:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command installs dependencies such as `streamlit`, `pandas`, and other libraries essential for the application's functionality.

### üöÄ Launching the Application
